POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC:0 "Doused in mustard gas and left to die in a collapsing dugout, Adolf Hitler's miraculous fight for survival during the Weltkrieg was a personal struggle unmatched even by the contents of his famous diary, of which remained the only evidence that the charred body lying beside it was his own. Misidentified as killed in action, in reality Hitler spent several restless days and nights seeking food and shelter while hindered with a broken arm and irritated lungs. Through sheer willpower, Hitler was able to return to his home in Munich, where he spent the next few years quietly recovering, and pursuing his ambition of becoming a painter. The years were peaceful, but deep inside, Hitler yearned to utilize his nationalist ideals to protect Germany from the encroaching threat of Syndicalism in Europe. It was this desire which brought him to join the leading nationalist party, the DVLP. Awakening a newfound charisma, Hitler quickly became a captivating, if not outspoken member. Disappointed with the party's direction however, Hitler left in search of other likeminded individuals. In a strange twist of fate, Hitler's departure saved him from facing tribunals at the hands of a new Syndicalist Revolution which swept across Germany. Surviving the bloodshed, Hitler soon learned of Josef Goebbels, a man who sought to unify the German people under a new banner of 'National-Marxism' but failed to gain traction with his peers. Intrigued with the concept, Hitler met with Goebbels and the two shared a fateful conversation which revitalized their outlook on a socialized Germany. Employing the vast forces of Goebbel's unified nationalists, the two staged a coup which overthrew the underprepared Syndacalists. Now with complete power, Adolf Hitler espouses a new ideology, a kind of nationalistic-socialism which aims to transform Germany from a collapsing empire to an insurmountable superpower."
