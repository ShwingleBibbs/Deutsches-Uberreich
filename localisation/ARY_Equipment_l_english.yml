 ARY_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mauser G. 98"
 ARY_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Gewehr 98 (Rifle 98) was the standard German infantry weapon of the Weltkrieg. It is a good example of the type of military rifle designed around the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when rifle development reached fever pitch. In common with other armies, the German infantry carried a full length rifle, while other troops were issued with shorter carbines. The bolt and magazine system of the Gewehr 98 was designed by the Mauser company, although the rifle was produced under licence by a number of other commercial manufacturers. It was a well-made and accurate weapon, but was not well suited to trench warfare."

 ARY_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs."

 ARY_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed by the Mauser company in response to a desire of the German Army for a self-loading rifle with a backup bolt action, the Selbstladegewehr 40 is a massive leap forward in German small arms design. While initial prototypes were highly inaccurate, heavy, and prone to jamming, the Heer eventually dropped some of its other specific requirements for the rifle. The end result was the initial prototype with only a few design edits, and it proved effective."

 ARY_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Maschinenkarabiner 42 is a revolutionary design chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, developed by famous German arms designer Hugo Schmeisser, in conjunction with the Haenel company. While the first prototype of the rifle was prone to jamming, both the military and even the Kaiser himself were extremely enthusiastic about the project, and immense resources were concentrated on improving the design, with the rifle deemed ready for adoption in 1942."

 ARY_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Gewehr 98/38, also simply known as the G. 98/38, is a bolt-action rifle, sometimes considered a carbine, and based heavily on the Gewehr 98. The rifle is rather short, at only one metre long. Originally designed for the Mountain troops, the G. 98/38 was soon adopted by other German forces, including some cavalry and infantry regiments."

 ARY_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "The M.P. 40, sometimes incorrectly called 'Schmeisser', was developed by Heinrich Vollmer and based on M.P. 38, with the aim of equipping German soldiers with an assault weapon. It uses magazines of 32 cartridges of 9mm, with its effective range being about 100-150 metres. It is a very reliable and particularly economical weapon to manufacture, usually used by officers, mechanised infantry and paratroopers."

 ARY_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Maschinenkarabiner 44 is the outcome of the German need to provide infantrymen with heavier firepower from their rifles. As a result of the continuous development of M.Kb. 42, the M.Kb. 44 is devoid of many of the disadvantages of the previous design and is even sometimes called the 'Sturmgewehr' - the assault rifle. The final design has a shorter range than contemporary rifles due to German research that most of the combat in the European War takes place at distances less than 300 metres. At the sacrifice of range, close range firepower was greatly improved."

The range of the first Panzerabwehrrohr was only 30 metres, which made their use somewhat hazardous, until more developed variants with increased range came to production."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers.

 ARY_motorized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The German Army in the early 1930s had more than 100 different vehicle designs in service, leading to massive logistical difficulties. In order to standardise their vehicle fleet, they opted for a commercial truck design by Adam Opel AG of Brandenburg to become their standard cargo truck. With only slight modifications to meet military requirements, presented in 1930, the Opel Blitz was accepted in service with designation Kraftfahrzeug 305 and by 1936 became the main truck of the German Army. Although well built, the Kfz.305 suffers from being rather too complicated for reliability in the rugged conditions, but still has better performance than other German trucks."

Initially intended to be a prime mover, the Sd.Kfz. 11 soon was transferred to the role of a transporter, when the need for an all-terrain vehicle became apparent.

Introduced in 1944 the Schwerer Schützenpanzerwagen “Kätzchen” (Heavy Armoured Personnel Carrier 'Kitten') had the hull's shape similar to the hull of the Stu.Pz.Kpfw. VII, but much smaller. The vehicle has front wheel drive with five or six overlapping steel road wheels and was designed to attain speeds in excess of 50 km/hr and has light armour.

Ordered in 1935 for use by German Army engineers, the Landwasserschlepper (Land Water Tractor) was intended as a lightweight river tug with some capacity to operate on land. Designed by Borsig of Düsseldorf, the hull of the L.W.S. is similar to that of a motor launch, resembling a tracked boat with twin rear-mounted tunnelled propellers and twin rudders. On land, it moves on steel-shod tracks with four bogies per side."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed.
