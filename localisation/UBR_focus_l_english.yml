Instead, what Hitler saw before him was an immortal empire of Aryans, forever free from the shackles of semitic trickery and mixed-race inferiority. This empire will stretch over the entirety of not just Earth, but the universe as well."

UBR_breitspurbahnen:0 "Reichsautobahnen"
UBR_breitspurbahnen_desc:0 "While the Old Empire did little for us and for the German worker, at the very least it's undeniable it had done wonders to improve its infrastructure. However the Kaiser as usual had not done enough. Today we are beginning work on a grand and ambitious program, the Breitspurbahnen or Double Gauge Railway, which will link the cities of our nation with large gauge railways carrying our noble citizens on grand Hotels of the Rails, the double decker railroad coaches. It will be a time consuming project as much of the existing railway has to be torn up as well to be remade to fit with our new ones, but the time taken will be earned back ten fold by the speed and safety we will achieve on our new rails."
UBR_welfare:0 "People's Welfare"
UBR_welfare_desc:0 "The Kaiser served not the worker but the Junker nobility who did nothing but oppress us! This was perfectly demonstrated with his not only inability to do anything to alleviate our suffering during Black Monday, but also his outright refusal to do so! Now with the worker in power we will remedy his mistakes! We shall institute a generous welfare program to alleviate the plight of the common man using funds seized from the decadent Junkers."

UBR_staatsfeind_nr1_desc:0 "'They lay among us, everywhere these inventors and propagators of Judeo-Marxism. These Jewish snakes lie in the bush, controlling the Bankers both abroad and even at home, awaiting the perfect time to strike our workers' paradise and pull us back into their degenerate hands!'\nIn a recent speech Adolf Hitler has lashed out at the Bankers both foreign and domestic. He has declared them Staatsfiend No 1, Public Enemy Number 1, and ordered the Army to round up any remaining bankers still hiding out in German borders, Jewish or not, and to seize what few private banks have remained open in the government’s blind spots."
UBR_germany_reborn:0 "Germany Reborn"
UBR_germany_reborn_desc:0 "Through hard work, grit and determination we have built a new Germany on the ashes of the old. Many thought that building a workers utopia by carving out the heart of reaction was impossible, much less that it would last as long as it has. However we have proven them wrong and we stand poised to bring our new German revolution to the whole world!"
UBR_form_the_guard:0 "Form the KdV"
UBR_form_the_guard_desc:0 "While the Army is certainly a vanguard of the Revolution, historically the military has also been a haven for reactionary elements. Look to one of innumerable military coups through history to show that the Army can be both our greatest strength and our most fierce enemy. To safeguard our revolution with a truly revolutionary military organ, we shall form the Peoples Guard Corps, the KdV, to defend the Revolution. They will get the best training and equipment our state can provide and are charged with protecting the revolution from all domestic enemies while guarding the state itself. Some say the KdV is just a National-Marxist terrorist squads given a new name, but they usually dont say stuff like that after a visit from them."
UBR_kulturkampf:0 "Kulturkampf"
UBR_kulturkampf_desc:0 "The Church and other organizations associated with it are deeply ingrained into German society. This has given them a degree of power that we find unacceptable, especially since the Church denies our legitimacy. However, now we feel secure enough to go after the Church. Dissident priests will be replaced, iconography will be destroyed and a new 'Holy Book', Das Kapital will be distributed instead of the Bible. This new Church of the Worker will have no hierarchy and will harbor no ill will to the State. Now not only have we saved the worker in the physical realm but also in the spiritual as well."
UBR_first_congress_of_german_unions:0 "First Congress of German Unions"
UBR_first_congress_of_german_unions_desc:0 "Today the National People's Union of Germany, the big tent coalition of Syndicalist and left leaning groups and unions that led the Revolution, has collapsed. With all its factions pulling it in radically different directions at the same time, it was only a wonder that it survived as long as it has. To prevent the nation from falling into anarchy the Government has called the First Congress of the German Unions to hash out the factions' differences and see which one will lead us into the future."
UBR_iva:0 "I.v.A."
UBR_iva_desc:0 "To begin the process of breaking down the old bourgeois order and building a new and equitable system, we shall start the Industrie Verstaatlichung Aktion, or I.v.A. to begin nationalizing the factories that dot our nation. In some areas like the Ruhr, where our Revolution began, this will be only a formality as workers unions seized their workspaces ages ago. However, in more conservative areas like Bavaria we might have to resort to force to detach the old order from their wealth."
UBR_rva:0 "R.v.A."
UBR_rva_desc:0 "To secure the foundation of our national prosperity the Government has begun the Ressourcen Verstaatlichung Aktion, or R.v.A, to seize the mines, saw mills and other raw resource producers for the greater good. This will be markedly easier than going straight after the factories as many of the blue collar labourers who made up the bulk of our Revolution worked in these areas. All it will be for the most part is putting a bureaucrat there to help the locals integrate more into the national economy."
UBR_found_the_fdj:0 "Found the HJ"
UBR_found_the_fdj_desc:0 "If Germany is to survive the coming trials we must forge the Germans anew. The past decades of prosperity have made our people fat and lazy and decadent. This generation is long gone, having only barely come back into the light soon enough to retire and die. The next generation however is still able to be saved from themselves. To do this Hitler has created the Hitlerjugend, or the Hitler Youth which is an organization which promotes healthy living, Nationalist and Socialist values, and military discipline. The HJ will also be compulsory so we can be sure all of Germany’s children will receive the right teaching."
UBR_nationalize_ufa:0 "Nationalize UFA"
UBR_nationalize_ufa_desc:0 "Hitler has a talent for speaking. It was his speeches to the masses and to the Congress that got him his job. Now, with himself having complete control, he shall seek to be sure all will hear his voice. To do this UFA, the largest media conglomerate in Germany, shall be nationalized. Before now its reluctant cooperation with the Government has been tolerated, but no more. WIth the UFA under government control it will become yet another arm of Government propaganda to show the German people the real truths of the world, just as Hitler sees them."
UBR_faud_victory:0 "FAUD Victory"
UBR_faud_victory_desc:0 "During the First Congress the Free Workers Union of Germany, the Anarchists, have managed to take control. Promising nigh unlimited freedoms and complete liberation of the worker they have managed to secure their hold on the reigns of power. Its many critics describe them as anti-State Statists with all the contradictions and hypocrisy such a label brings. We will prove them wrong."
UBR_sepd_victory:0 "SMEPD Victory"
UBR_sepd_victory_desc:0 "After all the debating, shouting and accusing has come to an end we have elected the SMEPD, the remnants of the Big Tent coalition that once ruled the nation, has secured victory. While not totally unexpected an a continuation of the old powers, they still have many challenges ahead fo them. Germany still reels from the War, the economy is in tatters and already the party is breaking into factions. All that remains is to see which one will lead us into our glorious victory."
UBR_nmdvp_victory:0 "NMDVP Victory"
UBR_nmdvp_victory_desc:0 "In a massive shock, Joseph Goebbels and his minority NMDVP has won out during the Congress. Electrifying delegates and the public alike with his fiery speeches he has done the seemingly impossible. Promising a National Renewal among Nationalist and Syndicalist lines his victory is seen as a victory for the extremists within our nation. His few supporters rejoice in the streets while the rest of the nation, and the world, looks on anxiously and wonders what this firebrand will do next."
UBR_kommandowirtschaft:0 "Kommandowirtschaft"
UBR_kommandowirtschaft_desc:0 "To leave the economy up to the individual is short sighted and inefficient. People are only out to help themselves and either do not or refuse to see the bigger picture. The Government must have total control over the economy because only the Government can see the bigger picture and also care for everybody. To do this we have established the Kommandowirtschaft, the Command Economy which will set up special 'Command Bureaus' to run sections of the economy according to Government orders."
UBR_form_the_stasi:0 "Form the Stasi"
UBR_form_the_stasi_desc:0 "During the time of the old Empire the Abwher was the most powerful intelligence organization under the sun. It kept tabs on all dissidents within Germany while maintaining an extensive foreign spy network. We must surpass this legacy if we are to be truly secure. Our new intelligence agency, the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit or more simply, The Stasi, will be charged with keeping tabs on all citizens both foreign and domestic while maintaining complete visibility over our future enemies abroad. By casting such a wide net, no enemy of the state or Revolution will go unnoticed."
UBR_gleichschaltung:0 "Gleichschaltung"
UBR_gleichschaltung_desc:0 "The Gleichschaltung, or Coordination, will bring all aspects of civil and social life into line with the Party and with Hitler. There are still many miscellaneous organizations which have escaped our consolidation ranging from medical charities that receive government funding to more major government agencies. With this new law all of them will be brought closer to the government and therefore are easier to control."
UBR_volksfuhrer:0 "Hail the Volksführer"
UBR_volksfuhrer_desc:0 "The time is right to take the final move to consolidate our power. Our Revolution is under constant assault from malicious outside actors and devilish fifth columns within our own nation. If we are to stand against them and save the people from oppression we must stand united. With the new Volksfuhrer-Erlass we will consolidate the positions of Head of State, Head of Government and Commander in Chief into one position, the Volksfuhrer. This position will obviously be held by Goebbels, the leader of our nation and the singular Vanguard of the German Revolution!"
UBR_anhaltelager:0 "Anhaltelager"
UBR_anhaltelager_desc:0 "With most of the syndicalist leadership executed for their heinous crimes against Germany, what remains of their supporters has been pockets of dysgenic, perverted freaks who curse and spit on all that our new Reich stands for. Queers, pedophiles and pornographers are all major targets to be transferred into our new labor camps. These specially constructed facilities will punish these traitorous malcontents by forcing them to finally give back to their country."
UBR_night_of_the:0 "Kristallnacht"
UBR_night_of_the_desc:0 "Despite our great strides to consolidate the state under our leadership we still have to contend with pockets of internal dissent largely focused around remaining Jews residing in Germany. We must deal with them and tighten our grip on the reigns of power."
UBR_spd_victory:0 "SPD-R Victory"
UBR_spd_victory_desc:0 "After much debate the SPD-R has emerged victorious. Led by Karl Liebknekt it promises Syndicalist democracy for all along with a radical expansion of rights. This has been met with derision and anger from the more radical aspects of our new nation but for the most part the people seem to support the new administration. Having only tasted autocracy for its history the German people are ready for true democracy to light a torch of freedom for all of Europe and the World to follow."
UBR_thalmann:0 "Thälmann"
UBR_thalmann_desc:0 "After a short power struggle within the SMPED the traditional Syndicalists have managed to beat out the old school Bolsheviks. As a radical departure from the Kaiser its expected that the new Chairman will have a lot of work to do. Ahead of him Thalmann will have to build a new society built of equity for the worker and equality for all where once strict stratification and autocracy ruled. With help from across the border and with preservation however its inevitable the Workers Dream will come to Germany."
UBR_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik:0 "Deutsche Syndikalistische Republik"
UBR_deutsche_syndikalisiische_republik_desc:0 "Up until now we have still maintained our declaration of an Emergency Socialist Government. However with the Revolution over and our power secured its finally time to do away with the temporary faucets of our government and build a new, Syndicalist state with a new Constitution and radically new laws to reflect our new values."
UBR_syndicalist_education:0 "Syndicalist Education"
UBR_syndicalist_education_desc:0 "The old education system was built to uphold a system of oppression and degradation for the masses. If we are to liberate not only the present but the future we must retool our ancient education system to teach the values of equality, liberation and solidarity with our children’s comrades."
UBR_pieck:0 "Pieck"
UBR_pieck_desc:0 "After a short power struggle in SMEPD the Old Bolsheviks have emerged victorious over the Classic Syndicalists. Loyal to the ideals of Lenin and the failed Russian Revolution they aim to do what Lenin could not and create a dictatorship of the proletariat in Germany. All will be equal and the Bolsheviks can once more become the vanguard of the Revolution like they were before the disgrace in Russia."
UBR_one_union:0 "One Union"
UBR_one_union_desc:0 "German trade unions are currently a mish mash of varying and sometimes competing organizations. Their incessant feuding has become a running joke among rightists as “the only thing a Union man hates more than a capitalist is another Union man”. To remedy this problem we will reorganize all of Germany’s unions along a new and strict regimen. United in structure and purpose they can stand together as a bulwark against counterrevolution."
UBR_integration:0 "Integration"
UBR_integration_desc:0 "In our new Germany there will be a place for all, none should be without work. Some economists say this is literally impossible and if possible, bad for the economy but we will show them wrong. We shall send agents out across Germany to establish permanent (and compulsory for the unemployed) job fairs so all those without jobs will get them. Once we are out of jobs, we will simply carve niches out of existing positions to make new jobs for the rest of them."
UBR_free_universities:0 "Syndicalist Universities"
UBR_free_universities_desc:0 "Education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don’t need little changes, we need gigantic, monumental changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce; they should be making six figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for the government and absolutely free of charge to its citizens, just like national defense. In the Old Germany a university education was out of the question for the vast majority of people. Those who got said education formed an upper crust of lower society which kept the proletariat uneducated and subdued. In our new Germany all universities will be public and will be free! If a man or woman wants to learn about the world he inhabits there should be no barriers to his or her pursuit of that knowledge."

UBR_mfsp_desc:0 "The newly established Ministry of Special Projects has been founded to utilize the greatest minds of our country to keep us on the frontiers of civil and military sciences.

We know that if we don’t create these inventions then someone else will and use them against us!."
UBR_neue_schwerindustrie:0 "Neue Schwerindustrie"
UBR_neue_schwerindustrie_desc:0 "Germany is the industrial heartland of Europe. Our factories are the greatest on the Continent and even rival or surpass the titans of America and Russia in efficiency. However our leaders have big plans for Germany’s future and if they are to achieve them then we must reach ever greater heights. That is why the government has aided our biggest factories in expanding even more while founding many more new factories across the nation."
UBR_spzproj_uran:0 "Spz.Proj. URAN"
UBR_spzproj_uran_desc:0 "Special Projekt URAN, led by Walter Gerlach, is the project aiming to use fissionable materials like uranium to create new sources of power. Another avenue is the creation of a long theorized uranium bomb which scientists predict could level entire cities with just one bomb. If their predictions are true then we must get this weapon before our enemies do. Who can resist us if our words are backed by nuclear weapons!"
UBR_spzprojpfeil:0 "Spz.Proj.PFEIL"
UBR_spzprojpfeil_desc:0 "Special Projekt PFEIL, named after the German word for arrow, is a top secret development project headed by Walther von Braun to create long range ballistic weapons. Dr von Braun has been petitioning the government for funding for a project like this since the Kaiser sat on his throne. Now with all the money he could want he assures us he will have a working V-1 Rocket ready within a few years at most. Von Braun himself aims for space though, we shall however aim for our enemies."
UBR_industrial_unionisation:0 "Industrial Unionization"
UBR_industrial_unionisation_desc:0 "In a move that has frankly taken too long to go through with, we shall nationalize all industries and hand their day to day operations to various unions across the nation.

UBR_ressource_redistribution_desc:0 "To aid in the maximization of our resources we shall nationalize all our lands resources.

UBR_union_trade_committee_desc:0 "In accordance with the recently passed Law on the Organization of National Trade Unions a new Union Trade Committee will be founded.

Today these decrepit estates shall be broken up and handed over to local Agrarian Communes who can more easily administer their own land.

The elitist artistic world will be broken down and remade into a series of Artisan Communes where everything from the tools they use to the art they make will be the property of the Commune and the Country and for all to see. Government stipends and individual donations will keep these communes solvent as selling art deprives it from the proletariat."
UBR_einigkeit_recht:0 "Einigkeit, Recht....."
UBR_einigkeit_recht_desc:0 "The first two principles our new nation will be founded on are unity, the unification of the German people under the red banner of Syndicalism and Justice, the equalization of a long held discriminatory justice system. Now not only could the average citizen see his work affect the prosperity of his community and nation but now he knows that any wrongs against him will be solved through the justice system and restore some of his lost faith in the government who has long turned his back on him."
UBR_woman_suffrage:0 "Woman Suffrage"
UBR_woman_suffrage_desc:0 "In most of the world, and even Germany before our Revolution, women were treated as less than people. They were simply servants you can lay with and will have your children. This is a deeply misogynistic world view and completely against the views of our new Germany. As one of our first decrees since taking power, giving basic rights to women shows the world and the people just how committed to equality we are."
UBR_liberal_education:0 "Liberal Education"
UBR_liberal_education_desc:0 "The national education system is a mess and tries to hammer into our next generation that the deeply flawed system we overthrew was just and right and natural. All of this was sometimes done in lieu of actual education. More radical Congress members want to indoctrinate our kids like the Empire did, just into the correct system this time. However, we know to sink to their level will show us as no better than the oppressors we overthrew. Instead we will strip all political and religious themes from our education system and focus solely on the sciences."

UBR_antiauthoritarian_education_desc:0 "Children are all unique. To shove them all in a room for eight hours a day and expect all of them to listen as a teacher drones on is foolish. Instead our leaders have found truth in the words of educator Maria Montessori, who believes in free thinking and self correction for students. We shall invite her to Berlin to help us form our new education system. Be it outside, hands on learning for the more physical amongst them or using the latest technology to ensnare their active imaginations in the vivid pictures of history we will grant our teachers the tools necessary to make our next generation the most educated in history."

UBR_communal_universities_desc:0 "The classic interpretation of a University is way too rigid for our new Germany. Instead the university system will be replaced with an ecosystem of University Communes where students will not only receive the best education in Europe but will meet and converse with their peers and form bonds that will last the rest of their lives."
UBR_humane_pensions:0 "Humane Pensions"
UBR_humane_pensions_desc:0 "Our aging generation risked it all to form this new and free world. They have done the impossible and turned a world of backwards reaction and close mindedness into one where the worker walks freely and equally with even the highest government officials. For their sacrifices they must be rewarded in their much earned retirement. A new pension will be established for all retirees within our nation over the age of 65. It has been described as generous into excess but it is the least we could do for the Greatest Generation."
UBR_und_freiheit:0 "....und Freiheit"
UBR_und_freiheit_desc:0 "Freedom. Seven letters with a titanic amount of meaning. As the last of the four principles it is the most important. Our people will be free from oppression, free from want, free from need. Free from the horrors of war and free from the horrors of poverty. Free from discrimination at home and free from loss. The German people have finally tasted true and purely unfiltered Freedom and have grown to desire it. We would all rather die, down to the last man, woman and child, rather than give it up to another tyrant!"
UBR_socialmarket_economics:0 "Social-Market Economics"
UBR_socialmarket_economics_desc:0 "To continue the capitalistic economy under the Kaiser would be abetting in oppression. However, we acknowledge that those who worked hard under the previous system deserve to keep what they clawed from the bourgeois’s greedy hands. To take that away from them would wipe away any want or ambition in our people. To remedy this problem we have begun to build a new Social-Market Economy where private ownership is allowed but major industries are nationalized. Some denounce this is as capitalist oppression in red paint, but the results will speak for themselves."
UBR_worker_rights:0 "Worker Rights"
UBR_worker_rights_desc:0 "Without rights the Worker is just a slave. Their bosses would much rather they become slaves as that would lead to greater profits. However, as a modern and progressive society we cannot allow such barbarity. We shall spell out and enshrine workers rights to fair wages and to organize and create a new organization, Abteilung für Arbeitssicherheit, to oversee that these rights are never to be infringed. The AfA will have the power to close down offending businesses and levy steep fines against offending bosses. With this new power the boss will be forced to work with their workers and not lord over them."
UBR_support_startups:0 "Support Startups"
UBR_support_startups_desc:0 "Small businesses are the backbone of a modern economy, Syndicalist or not. To restore our nation's shattered economy we will start giving promising startups generous government grants to kickstart the economic recovery our people have been pleading for for so long."

UBR_german_industrial_miracle_desc:0 "Numbers don't lie and the numbers show that not only have we recovered from Black Monday but we have even begun to surpass economic output before the crash! This would’ve been impossible if we leaned too hard towards Syndicalism or turned to straightforward Capitalism. It's only the genius of our economic planning and collaboration with private sectors that we achieved such prosperity! We have saved Germany!."
UBR_return_to_the_worldstage:0 "Return to the World Stage"
UBR_return_to_the_worldstage_desc:0 "Now that we have solidified our rule at home and fixed our broken economy we can turn to our foreign ambitions. Germany before the Revolution was a world leader. While it was a world leader in oppression and reactionary violence, its power was undeniable and irresistible. We must take up its mantle as a world power, but now it will be in support of the Revolution and not fighting against it."
UBR_formation_of_the_nva:0 "Formation of the Wehrmacht"
UBR_formation_of_the_nva_desc:0 "Now that our industry is humming along at sufficient capacity we can turn to reorganizing our military into the National Wehrmacht with three planned branches, the Nationale Kriegsmarine or the Navy, the Nationale Luftwaffe or Air Force and the Nationale Heer or the Army. This new Wehrmacht will be more modern and more effective than the old Imperial military could ever have been. They will be the defenders of the revolution at home and even abroad!"
UBR_nationales_volksheer:0 "Nationales Heer"
UBR_nationales_volksheer_desc:0 "The Nationales Heer is to be the land arm of our military. Its organization is still up to some debate but what is not up to debate is the primacy of the Heer in our new military. What we call our ‘army’ now is little more than a grouping of ragtag militia who have elected to not disband after the Civil War. It will take tremendous effort and more importantly, money to turn these militia into a professional and disciplined fighting force. However it must be done if our state is to be secure."
UBR_nationale_volksmarine:0 "Nationale Kriegsmarine"
UBR_nationale_volksmarine_desc:0 "The National Kriegsmarine is the naval branch of our new military. We received a few ships during the Civil War but they are still being run by a cobbled together hierarchy of sailors communes and self-administering ships. The ships themselves are also falling further behind in technology. Any respectable nation has a navy, and a great power like us must have a grand navy to rival all others if our seas are to be safe from foreign incursion."
UBR_nationale_luftwaffe:0 "Nationale Luftwaffe"
UBR_nationale_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Nationale Luftwaffe will be the air force of our military. As the newest of our independent branches of the military this one will be the easiest to restructure. While the Army and Navy have centuries of tradition to uproot and turn almost entirely on its head, the Luftwaffe has only been around a few decades. The old Luftstriekcrafte is dead and from its ashes a new Luftwaffe will rise, proud and most importantly, Red."
UBR_skilled_officers:0 "Skilled Officers"
UBR_skilled_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. One camp argues that we must pursue the most skilled officers within our nation. Unfortunately many of the most skilled officers remaining in our nation are former Imperial officers. These men fought in Africa against the Mau Mau, against the Viet Minh in Indochina, or even in the Weltkrieg itself. Some worry that giving these men who gave their lives to the Kaiser power within our military would only invite counterrevolution. However, this is a risk we must take to make our military more effective."
UBR_elected_officers:0 "Elected Officers"
UBR_elected_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. Some have argued for us to not recruit officers for our soldiers. Instead we should allow our units to elect their own officers from within. These men would undoubtedly inspire loyalty within our units to their commanders and their country. These officers would be only minorly reviewed and as such presents one major problem. It's always a risk that our noble soldiers would just elect a slacker or a ‘good ol boy’ who wouldn’t discipline the troops as well. They could elect bad officers who don’t know how to lead. However this is a risk worth taking to placate our soldiers and show just how democratic our state is."
UBR_political_officers:0 "Political Officers"
UBR_political_officers_desc:0 "One of the most basic questions of our new military is how we will recruit the officers. A vocal part of our military argues for political officers, chosen for their loyalty rather than their credentials as an officer necessarily. They say the military, despite how vital it is, is also a traditional hub of counterrevolution. They point to the history of military leaders overthrowing progressive regimes in support of oppression. The risks of this are obvious as a political officer might be more interested in enforcing Party loyalty and ideological purity than actually leading his troops. This is a small sacrifice to make however if our state is to remain safe from opponents both foreign….and domestic."
UBR_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
UBR_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe will focus on building more and greater bombers. Bombing from the air is even newer than the concept of flight, only really taking off during the tail end of the Weltkrieg. However colonial conflicts abroad have shown the effectiveness of bombers. Their ability to drop tons of high explosives on enemy positions with little fear of retaliation make them an excellent force mitigator. Not only that but the morale effect of an endless rain of bombs is undeniable. As such, we shall fill the sky with our metal birds and crater the ground with their firety rain of death!"
UBR_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
UBR_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The concept of fighter aircraft is not new to us. They proved their use quickly in the Great War and have been a foundation of every air force in the world. By denying our enemy control of the skies we won't have to worry about their bombers terrorizing our soldiers and we could even send our bombers out instead. Not only that but German companies like Focke-Wulf and Messerschmitt have been recognized as some of the best fighter producers in the world. To turn our backs on them would be idiocy."
UBR_carrier_focus:0 "Carrier Focus"
UBR_carrier_focus_desc:0 "It's a simple fact that planes can travel much further than meer shells. Early tests done in the 1920s and early 1930s have suggested that seaplanes, or these so called ‘aircraft carriers’ with traditionally land based planes could revolutionize warfare at sea! We have recognized this and as a revolutionary government its only proper we have a revolutionary Navy. We will focus our efforts on building up Carrier fleets and using them to crush our enemies at sea before they can even see us."
UBR_battleship_focus:0 "Battleship Focus"
UBR_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Those with the biggest ships rule the seas. This has been an undisputed fact for thousands of years. Now however people begin to think planes and defenseless carriers could unseat the traditional kings of the oceans? Pah! We shall prove them all wrong! We will build titanic fortresses at sea with enough guns to sink an island! Anybody who challenges us will die under a hail of shells and salvos!"
UBR_panzertruppe:0 "Panzertruppe"
UBR_panzertruppe_desc:0 "As we rebuild our Army we have come to the conclusion that tanks and motorized vehicles are the future. Not only can they go faster than any man could ever hope to, a tank or truck only wants for fuel and parts. Not only that but they can even hold a whole squad or more of men and take them with them. Using their rapid movement and the tanks' hard hitting power, we can break through their lines and win through Bewegungskrieg or Maneuver Warfare."
UBR_panzergrenadiere:0 "Panzergrenadiere"
UBR_panzergrenadiere_desc:0 "Infantry have been the foundation of the army. Some say the new innovation of the tank should deprive them of this place of reverence. We shall relegate tanks to their true role as support for the true hammer of the Proletariat, the valiant infantry. Using vehicles they will achieve a sense of mobility unseen since Napoleon’s lighting campaigns through Italy and Germany. With adequate support these mechanized spearheads will be impossible to stop."
UBR_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
UBR_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines, or U-boats, did wonders in the last war and technology can only make them better for the next war. Unseen and deadly silent the enemy won't see them until they are already slipping under the sea on their burning wrecks. WIth enough wolf packs prowling the sea we can strangle any enemy into submission without even having to fire a shot on land"
UBR_cruiser_focus:0 "Cruiser Focus"
UBR_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "With our surface fleet growing exponentially we will need sufficient surface support. While u-boats proved their merit in the Weltkrieg, to use them in the next war would play directly into the enemy's hands. Anti-submarine warfare technology has grown by leaps and bounds. Instead we will focus on building surface ships like cruisers and destroyers to both protect our bigger ships while striking down the subs of our enemies."

UBR_oknvh_desc:0 "The Oberkommando Nationale Heer is just the latest iteration of the vaunted German General Staff. Its incessant planning and meticulous calculations have done our great nation wonders in the wars from the Franco-Prussian to the Weltkrieg. While the old General Staff is too reactionary and dissentious to be of much use, this has left us with a great opportunity. Doing away with those grey haired fossils will allow for younger minds with newer ideas to rise further through the ranks"

UBR_occupational_government_desc:0 "The German Empire is dead and rotting in the ground. The Kaiser has fled and his government has gone to ground. Now, we have been left with a new problem, the Kaiser’s people. They are people who lick boots for breakfast and piss shoe shine. To make them good Syndicalists is going to be an arduous task. The first step however is in some ways the hardest. We must give governance back to the Germans, under our watchful eye, to let them choose their future. One they might even learn to accept."
UBR_mass_conscription:0 "Overwhelming Numbers"
UBR_mass_conscription_desc:0 "After Russia our nation is the most populous in the world. This gives us a marked advantage over our enemies on the Continent. Some of our military theorists have argued that we must make use of these Human Waves or Menschenwelle, to drown our enemies in blood. Not only will we crush our enemies under their own dead bodies but the loss will forge our peoples spirit into one of iron and blood, able to take the losses necessary to achieve our destiny."
UBR_overwhelming_firepower:0 "Superior Firepower"
UBR_overwhelming_firepower_desc:0 "Artillery is a critical weapon on any modern battlefield. They can reduce walls and defenses in minutes and turn men into mulch in seconds. This has been known since Cannon was first used centuries ago. We shall equip all our units with their own artillery or mortars as is deemed appropriate so all our men can use this terrifying power to break their enemies before them."

UBR_oknvm_desc:0 "The Oberkommando Nationale Kriegsmarine will take over for the old Imperial Admiralty. The old Admiralty was fractious and divided and as such we had a rather lackluster performance at sea, worse than we should have been at the very least. To remedy this while the OK-NVM will itself be divided into several departments and such to better oversee the vastness of our navy, they will report to the Generalsstab-Marine, who will in turn consolidate everything into a report for a single man, the Chief of Naval Warfare, or CdF who will then make decisions. Some say this will be too much for one man to handle, but we know the power of a single man."
UBR_naval_support_focus:0 "Naval Support Focus"
UBR_naval_support_focus_desc:0 "While our navy is powerful it is still a fraction of what it was under the Kaiser. The navies of other nations dwarf ours in firepower and numbers. To remedy this situation the Luftwaffe will be ordered to primarily focus on supporting our valiant navy in its efforts to secure our seas. This may hamper its efforts to support the soldiers but the German Army has been unbeaten on land for decades, it doesn't need some metal birds to save it."
UBR_ground_support_focus:0 "Ground Support Focus"
UBR_ground_support_focus_desc:0 "As warfare has evolved control over the skies of the battlefield has become as necessary as control over something as basic as supplies. If our armies are to know victory we must make sure they won't have to spend half their time looking ot the skies as well as ahead of them. To that end the Luftwaffe has been ordered to focus on supporting our ground troops in their advance. This has been said to be done at the detriment to our Navy’s actions at sea but our Navy is powerful enough that it doesn't need to cower from airborne threats."

UBR_oknlw_desc:0 "Oberkommando Nationale Luftwaffe will be founded to organize the Air Force and concentrate its efforts. Led by the Generalsstab-Luftwaffe which will itself be led by the Grand Marshal of the Air Force. With this we will turn our disorganized smattering of squadrons into a true professional Air Force to match and even beat anything they may face."
UBR_hydroelectric_power:0 "Hydroelectric Power"
UBR_hydroelectric_power_desc:0 "To sustain our massive industrial power we need more energy, electricity. We have gained much of that from fossil fuels but much of it comes from imports. This leaves us vulnerable to the whims of other powers. To remedy this situation somewhat we shall develop our hydroelectric capacity. Germany has many rivers from large ones to the Rhine and the Elbe, to smaller ones like the Oder. We shall build as many dams as we can among them to draw nature's latent power from and harness that power into an industrial machine that can move heaven and earth."

He has begun speaking of starting the school of 'Nationalsozialistische Architektur' featuring grand victory arches, massive buildings and plazas, and four lane roads down every street.

UBR_GOEBBELS_DESC:0 "Before his rise to power Goebbels worked as a journalist and occasional Film Theater and Theater critique in his hometown of Rheydt. He was relatively well known in his home region and within the bigger cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Mönchengladbach near his hometown.\nHis early contact with Marxism during his youth and tendencies to Nationalism influenced his political leanings and ideological thought a lot which he had to hide during the reign of the Kaiser or he might have faced a ban on his journalism work due to repressions against far left writers in the German Empire.\nWhile not being in line with traditional Syndicalist or Socialist values he can be seen a a mirror to the French Sorelians with his Syncretism between ideological concepts that can be found within the far left and the far right he has manifested himself his very own ideology which he calls „National-Marxism“. It still remains questionable if it is actually different to Sorelian National-Syndicalism or if it even is 'Marxist' at all."
