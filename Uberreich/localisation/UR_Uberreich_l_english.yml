#### Events ####

uberreich.1.t:0 "Locked Out"
uberreich.1.d:0 "Barred entry from the elections for his extremist beliefs, and frustrated at the unanimous appointment of Thälmann, fringe political leader Josef Goebbels has announced that he is stepping down as the head of his scandalous totalist party, the NMVDP. While this move is sure to cause a reshuffling of leadership within the party, Goebbels has not fully withdrawn from politics and has told critics to expect more from him in the future."
uberreich.1.a:0 "Don't let the door hit you on the way out."

uberreich.2.t:0 "Knock Knock"
uberreich.2.d:0 "Late one night while Goebbels was clearing out his office, he heard a mysterious knock at the door. This perplexed him as he made it very clear he did not want to be disturbed. Frustrated, he walked over to the door and opened to see who was bothering him at this hour. What greeted him was a smile with a small moustache upon it. He only said a few words, "I have a proposition..."" 
uberreich.2.a:0 "...Go on."
uberreich.2.b:0 "Get out!"

uberreich.3.t:0 "The Putsch"
uberreich.3.d:0 "At midnight, ultranationalists organized a stunning raid on the Reichstag. Hundreds of armed men stormed the building, overpowering the inexperienced guards, and holding Thälmann at gunpoint while demanding his immediate resignation. The armed crowd made way for two figures who approached a now apprehended Thälmann. Recognizing one of the men as none other than Josef Goebbels, Thälmann shouted "Damn you traitor, you will never get away with your takeover!" Goebbels simply smiled and said "Oh you misunderstand, Thälmann. This isn't my takeover...It's his." Thälmann looked over with a furrowed brow at the mysterious man approaching from behind Goebbels, now front and center. With arms folded in front of him, the man's ice blue eyes shot a piercing gaze towards Thälmann, giving this new silence a deafening sound. It was in this moment, Thälmann realized that his political aspirations were over."
uberreich.3.a:0 "Deutschland Über Alles."
uberreich.3.b:0 "Reserve battalions encircle the agitators and end the coup."

#### Swabia Shit ####

uberreich.4.t:0 "Voyage of the MS Schwabenland"
uberreich.4.d:0 "Today the 57 men aboard the MS Schwabenland began their journey southward. With them is enough provisions to endure the trip and the necessary resources to construct a research base at their destination. In fair weather, the vessel is expected to reach the Antarctic continent within a month's time."
uberreich.4.a:0 "Good luck!"

uberreich.5.t:0 "Neu-Schwabenland"
uberreich.5.d:0 "After a patch of rough weather, the expedition landed on the frozen continent and placed the national flag into the ice, claiming the territory for Germany. This new territory was dubbed Neu-Schwabenland, named after the vessel which carried the crew. Some early surveys have already determined a profitable location to begin whaling operations, others indicate strategic positions to construct naval bases.\n\n Utilizing the seaplanes brought along the expedition, photographic survey flights have been ordered to chart areas too dangerous to reach on foot."
uberreich.5.a:0 "Excellent."

uberreich.6.t:0 "An impasse"
uberreich.6.d:0 "Analyzing the photos developed from the survey flights has revealed a series of previously undocumented cave entrances south of the research base. The journey to reach them would be treacherous, even with the aid of vehicles. The engineers of the crew have made their case to focus on the geological resource aspects of the expedition, for the sake of human safety. The scientists insist on making the perilous trek, for the sake of scientific documentation, and the chance to make history for their nation."
uberreich.6.a:0 "Onward!"
uberreich.6.b:0 "It's far too dangerous."

uberreich.7.t:0 "Volunteer mission"
uberreich.7.d:0 "The research team reached the coordinates provided and have made a fascinating discovery, a network of tunnel systems warm enough to support life! Unfortunately, several members of the expedition died during the journey and were buried beneath the national standard. The surviving researchers, eager to continue the exploration for the sake of their fallen comrades, have wasted no time venturing far below."
uberreich.7.a:0 "Godspeed."

uberreich.8.t:0 "The expedition returns home"
uberreich.8.d:0 "The crew of the MS Schwabenland has safely returned home following their long expedition in Antarctica. With them is key knowledge of strategic resource sites as well as meteorological data that should prove valulable to German scientists. With a new territory now claimed under the banner of Germany, the operation was deemed a overall success."
uberreich.8.a:0 "Welcome back!"

uberreich.9.t:0 "The Expedition returns home"
uberreich.9.d:0 "The crew of the MS Schwabenland has safely returned home following their long expedition in Antarctica. With them is key knowledge of strategic resource sites as well as meteorological data that should prove valulable to German scientists. With a new territory now claimed under the banner of Germany, the operation was deemed a overall success.\n\nSome scientists seemed noticably shaken by the experience, and were admitted to a hospital to treat their shock."
uberreich.9.a:0 "Welcome back!"

#### Vril Path ####

# Agartha

uberreich.10.t:0 "The emergence of Thule"
uberreich.10.d:0 "Late at night, Adolf Hitler was approached in his office by three men clad in black uniforms. Before he could demand how they got in, they explained themselves to him. They represent an esoteric society involved in racial theory, which fully embraced the tenants of Hitler's nationalized socialism.\n\nThey told Hitler that their organization intercepted several of the scientists who embarked on the secret anatarctic expedition, and the information extracted from them has the capability to transform not just Germany, but the aryan race in its entirety. They ask only that their group be sponsored by the party as a völkisch institution for the betterment of the German people."
uberreich.10.a:0 "...Deal."
uberreich.10.b:0 "Guards!"

uberreich.11.t:0 "Agartha entfesselt"
uberreich.11.d:0 "Under the watchful eye of Thule representatives, the operation to return to Antarctica was given the go-ahead. Veterans of the original expedition are now joined by an additional team of researchers who are no doubt employed by the secretive cult. In place of the original MS Schwabenland, the crew has instead been issued a custom-built saucer intended to travel at altitudes necessary to avoid detection by advanced radar.\n\nOnly a few short hours were necessary for the crew to touch down on the frozen continent, thus immediately beginning their expedition.\n\nUpon reaching the coordinates provided by the veteran scientists, the Thule representatives traversed far below the frozen ice shelves, entering a deep cavernous path of twisting tunnels. Warm air forced the team out of their heavy arctic attire as they journeyed forth, running into dead-end after dead-end. After several hours of exploration and desperate pleading from the veterans to return topside, one of the researchers was heard shouting from the depths. What the team saw when they reached him was beyond explanation, a temperate landscape of greenery laid before them basked in a golden light, an entire new world hidden from humanity beneath the arctic ice! In face of this groundbreaking discovery, The leading Thule representative merely smiled, "Finally, we are home.""
uberreich.11.a:0 "Mein Gott..."

# Anti-gravity

uberreich.14.t:0 "Scientific breakthrough"
uberreich.14.d:0 "After months of strenuous work, the joint venture between Dr. von Braun's aerospace development team and Thule's top researchers has isolated a compound that, when charged with electricity, harnesses such sheer kinetic energy that it begins levitating in place! The applications of such a discovery seem endless, yet work has already begun on a vessel designed specifically to store such a compound, intending to capitalize on its ability to seemingly defy gravity."
uberreich.14.a:0 "An unimaginable discovery!"

uberreich.16.t:0 "Saucer aircraft"
uberreich.16.d:0 "Continued experimentation with super-charged vessels of red mercury has resulted in the finalized production of an anti-gravity drive that our engineers have affectionally dubbed Die Glocke. Several designs were proposed for the utilization of this engine, but ultimately, a saucer shaped fusilage won out. Testing of this prototype 'Thule Machine' has shown extremely promising results, with our test pilots able to maneuver in any direction unimpeded. Unfortunately, due to the bulk of the hardware within the cockpit, weapons have yet to be mounted onboard, but our engineers promise that subsequent models with such capabilities are already in the works."
uberreich.16.a:0 "Amazing."

uberreich.17.t:0 "Lunar expedition"
uberreich.17.d:0 "With Dr. von Braun overseeing the project in its entirety, engineers have readied what they claim to be a model of saucer designed specifically with spacefaring in mind. Fitted with a state-of-the-art pressurization cabin and communication relay, the craft will be piloted by hand-picked 'Spacemen' equipped with advanced suits designed to endure the harsh environment of space. Due to the nature of the saucer's propulsion, no rocket boosters are necessary, allowing it to move gracefully without leaving behind any noticable smoketrails. In the final hours of preparation, the Führer demanded to join along as a passenger. Advisors pleaded with Hitler to reconsider, but there was no changing his mind.\n\n\nThe operation has been given the green light to commence."
uberreich.17.a:0 "Lift off!"

uberreich.18.t:0 "The Reichsadler has landed"
uberreich.18.d:0 "Feeling the solid lunar surface beneath his space boots, Adolf Hitler smiled behind his visored helmet as he looked back at Earth. To have come so far, in both distance and achievement, left an impression on him that he would never forget.\nAs the Führer pondered to himself, the Spacemen got to work collecting samples and running experiments, before finally planting the Reichsflagge into the dusty soil, claiming Earth's natural satellite for Germany. After several hours of research, the team packed up their instruments and prepared to return home. A few of them may have caught glimpses of their Führer jumping giddily around in low-gravity, but none would ever dare make mention of it."
uberreich.18.a:0 "I give you...The Moon!"


# Fuhrer HQ
uberreich.15.t:0 "Das Führerhauptquartiere"
uberreich.15.d:0 "Underneath Germany's urban centers now exists a sprawling network of bomb-proof corridors, connecting a massive subterranean fortress to preserve the continuation of government in the event of an attack. These bunkers allow not only for the safe travel of officials and their families, but also for the moving of military logistics without the threat of spylanes. Of course, such secretive lairs also allow for the continued research and development of closely guarded state secrets."
uberreich.15.a:0 "A true fortress."

#### Misc Events ####

uberreichmisc.991.t:0 "A Best Seller"
uberreichmisc.991.d:0 "Adolf Hitler's diary had already made waves with the German people, invoking wild feelings of patriotism at the price of Hitler's supposed demise. To the fans of his diary, Hitler has unveiled his latest work: 'Unser Kampf', Our Struggle. This time, nothing is left to the publisher's imagination, as Hitler vividly describes the scene of a Germany in ruins, destined to shake off its bounds and restore its greatness. This of course is only possible with the aid of Hitler's national-socialism, an ideology espoused often throughout the chapters.\n\n'Unser Kampf' has already become a bestseller in Germany, and will likely inspire many more."
uberreichmisc.991.a:0 "Germans just can't put it down!"

uberreichmisc.6969.t:0 "The conviction of Oskar Dirlewanger"
uberreichmisc.6969.d:0 "A silence of horror would be a fitting description of the ambience in court that day.\nDirlewanger was on trial for murder and rape of several minors, shocking even the experienced judges that day.\n\nHerr Dirlewanger pleaded guilty while showing off a grim smile, afterwards the judge sentenced him to..."
uberreichmisc.6969.a:0 "...death by hanging."

uberreichmisc.810.t:0 "Victory over Judeo-Marxism"
uberreichmisc.810.d:0 "After our proclamation of victory over Judeo-Marxism many of our supporters took it as a green light signal for escalation, and during the following nights Jewish stores and houses were raided by disorganized miltia amd common people alike."
uberreichmisc.810.a:0 "Uhh...based?"

uberreichmisc.1488.t:0 "An offer for South Georgia"
uberreichmisc.1488.d:0 "Germany has quietly approached us with an unusual offer, advanced payment for the ownership of South Georgia.\n\nWhile it remains unclear why Germany has a sudden desire to purchase the barren island, the most likely explanation is to establish a military sphere of influence in the Americas. To move forward with this offer would be seen as foolish by some, but the payment more than speaks for itself."
uberreichmisc.1488.a:0 "Deal."
uberreichmisc.1488.b:0 "No deal."

uberreichmisc.1489.t:0 "Our offer was rejected"
uberreichmisc.1489.d:0 "Negotiations for South Georgia have failed, it appears that our monetary incentive was not enough."
uberreichmisc.1489.a:0 "Scheiße!"

uberreichmisc.1490.t:0 "Our offer was accepted!"
uberreichmisc.1490.d:0 "Negotiations for South Georgia were successful, ownership of the island has been officially transferred to us."
uberreichmisc.1490.a:0 "Excellent!"

uberreichmisc.69.t:0 "A new Reichsflagge?"
uberreichmisc.69.d:0 "The expansion of the Reich brings us a new opportunity, the chance to redesign the national flag to better represent Germany. Several new designs have already been proposed.\n\n"

uberreichmisc.96.t:0 "A new Reichsflagge?"
uberreichmisc.96.d:0 "With the Endsieg in view, some at the Reichskanzlei believe that our current flag will simply not do our struggle justice. Several new designs have already been proposed.\n\n"
uberreichmisc.96.a:0 "The Vril Standard!"
uberreichmisc.96.b:0 "The Nordic Cross Motif!"

An employee at UFA who was responsible for creating background sounds with his Elektrophon and recordings of sounds he would manipulate, accidentally came up with a new form of music after speeding up the pitch and tempo of the track, now calling it 'Nachtkern Musik'. At first deemed Un-German by his superior, its 'happy' tone did catch the ear of Hitler during a routine visit.

The newly formed German Worker’s Front, or DAF, is expected to streamline and consolidate all national union bureaucracy into one unit to increase efficiency and save costs that would come with running multiple state unions. There is also a political aspect to it as well, as having one centralized union would ensure that less threats from organized labor would occur against the regime.

Dubbed the People’s Car, or the Volkswagen, it is significantly cheaper compared to the consumer vehicles on the market during the reign of the Kaiser while sacrificing little in terms of quality and efficiency. By allowing an affordable car to be given to the people of Germany, it is expected to reduce travel times to and from work while reducing the strain on public transport. Aside from the obvious efficiency increase, the car will now give German families more incentives to travel across Germany whether it be for leisure or vacation. As state automobile plants begin the first vehicles rolling off the assembly line, the Volkswagen is expected to be readily available in most major urban centers by the end of the year."

From UFA radio shows to the latest music, and even from the latest state news to speeches from the Führer himself, the new radio is expected to boost the morale of the average German household across the country. It also serves as a means of indoctrination, as the radios only broadcast state mandated programming, which may or may not be so subtle in spreading the NSDAP’s ideas into the subconscious of the German within his own home."

Named by the party leadership and the R&D labs as the Volksfernseher, this new device uses a cable transmission and radio signals to project images on a screen along with audio. While the current product is still early stage and expensive to produce, it hasn’t stopped the upper echelons of the party leadership from installing this “visual radio” into their own homes. Currently, there are only two channels on the Volksfernseher, one for news and one for entertainment which mostly consists of live music performances in various UFA studios. Not to mention getting a decent signal for the Volksfernseher is difficult as there isn’t sufficient civilian telecommunications infrastructure to support it. Despite the early shortcomings of the first few models, the NSDAP is confident that with more funding and attention that even the Volksfernseher might be able to overtake the radio one day."

Already certain towns and villages are being given giant state grants to build and renovate parks and leisure facilities such as sports centers, cinemas, and public restaurants. The KdF is also going as far as offering benefits to working German families to incentivize them to take vacations to state recommended locations, both within Germany and to other nations. While the KdF’s goal is certainly ambitious, the DAF is hopeful that this will end up greatly expanding the options of leisure for the people, which will help to boost, happiness, productivity, and loyalty."

Already, the paper is becoming widely distributed across newspaper stands and the doorsteps of German homes. Depending on the success of Der Volksgenosse as being the prime news outlet for the German people, there are potential plans to branch out into radio and cinema news as well once the remaining competitors are either nationalized and incorporated or driven out of the industry all together."

The sun is shining over the horizon as the fog disperses, with moist grass gleaming in the sunlight. It would be an idyllic day had it not been one of the hardest training days for the next generation of Germany’s elite officers. A group of candidates armed with shovels stand on the hard dirt in a field as their superiors watch, they are then given the orders to start digging a ditch for them to lay down in. The catch is that a tank on the other side of the field is about to start driving towards them. Should they dawdle, they will be run over. Should they run, they will be shot. The time starts, and the tank begins its approach. The candidates frantically dig the hole as the tank approaches ever closer. One brave candidate directs the others to dig in certain areas and encourages them to dig for their lives no mater how tired their bones may get. One tries to run as the tank nearly arrives, and is expectedly shot from a tower. The brave candidate directs his fellow companions to dig harder, to ignore the weak coward who ran for himself rather than help the many. As the tank arrives near meters away the ditch is complete, and the brave candidate ensures every man hops in before he does. As the tank passes over the exercise ends. When the superiors come down to congratulate the candidates, they give particular praise to the brave candidate who led his men with courage, who had put them before himself."

Being seen as foreign and responsible for the root of the suffering for the German worker since the middle ages, the Führer and the party leadership have been harassing Germany’s Jewish population since their ascension to power. Recently, the regime has been ramping up efforts to tackle the question of the Jews within Germany. To complete this task, Hitler has signed off on the creation of the Central Organization of Jewish Affairs, acting as a subdivision of the SS. Staffed by SS members with extensive knowledge on Judaism, with some even going as far as to speak Hebrew fluently, the division is expected by the regime to come up with plans to drive the Jewish population out of German lands or at least isolate them. Already, plans detailing agreements with the local governments within Madagascar and the Levant to accept Jewish emigrants along with the logistics for emigrating Jews to those lands are already starting to be drafted. Along with this come plans of concentrating urban Jewish populations into walled off ghettos within those urban centers, even with suspected coordinated harassment and attacks with the VR to give extra “encouragement” for the Jews to leave. Obvious human rights concerns have come up over these alleged plans with many governments accusing the NSDAP’s actions of being depraved and vile, with even some of Germany’s allies raising concerns in private. However, it is unlikely that these objections will change much if anything over the course Germany has decided to take with its Jewish population."

Throughout the day, members of this secretive force will tail enemies of the Revolution and keep tabs on the citizens of the city to ensure that they aren’t going against either Pieck or the Party. Should they see anything out of order, whether it be counterrevolutionary or just plainly illegal, said person should count on his life essentially being over before the day is finished. At night, when the workers are in their apartments and no one is on the streets, the secret police make their move. They barge into the homes of criminals and enemies of the Revolution, dragging them and their families out from their homes. The brave few who resist get a rifle butt to the face if they aren’t shot outright, as those who remain are loaded onto trucks headed for facilities god knows where. Their neighbors can only listen to the screams, shouts, and wails that cry out in the night as they take their friends and coworkers.

This new style dubbed Brutalismus, or Brutalism, is expected to revolutionize architecture in Germany and serve as a reminder of the future of Germany’s socialist future, along with said future’s superiority over the reactionary past.

What he did know that the high crimes of treason along with various claims of crimes against humanity during the civil war were enough for the judges to reach a conclusion within no more than two hours of each trials. Each time, almost unanimously, the sentence was always guilty with a punishment of death. In some instances, the accused were dragged outside so that the next poor soul on trial could be put on the chopping block, with the gunshots heard outside the courtroom being a foreshadowing of their fate once the gavel strikes."

His father has been a bureaucrat of the NSDAP since he fought with them during the revolution against the Kaiser, and his mother a proud homemaker who tended to the wounds of the revolution's heroes during their bloody struggle. On an early Saturday, both Rudi and Liesel were given money to buy fresh fruit and bread from the market for their household, a task the two especially enjoyed. In the open market where flags of the new Germany flew, the shoppers and shopkeepers greeted each other with salutes and “Heil Hitler!" before completing their transaction and waving farewell by doing the same. Rudi and Liesel became accustomed to this, after all it seemed only natural to thank the man who brought them prosperity anyway. As they were returning home from the market, something caught Rudi’s eye. A poster on a wall, on depicting three rats holding individual bayonets at Germany, exclaiming that “The Dangers to Germany Shall Threaten Us Until Destroyed!”. The first rat wore a beret and a mustache, the second a Pickelhaube with big red lips, and the third had curly hair and an elongated nose. Rudi knew immediately what they were; the deceitful French, and the treacherous Kaiser in Africa. His blood shot up and his face began to run red with anger. He stood there wishing the destruction of the enemies jealous of the new Germany and her prosperity. As Liesel called for him to continue, Rudi knew immediately what he wanted to be in the future. A soldier that pointed the bayonet back at the three rats."

Whatever the case may be, unionist councils are running a coordinated effort to overhaul education in all areas, from the curriculum to the facilities. Although the exact specifics of the Anarcho-Syndicalist curriculum may differ based on the area of Germany, there is a general agreement that children will be educated on the ideas of their society. The main tenants include emphasis on equity and cooperation among all peers, the encouragement of progressive ideals and experimentation, teaching students the inherent wrongs of the reactionary, capitalistic, and imperialistic Germany’s of yore, and the inner workings of the Anarcho-Syndicalist system and the ideals that power it. Some families claim that the new curriculum is purely ideological and doesn’t prepare the next generation for actual work. In some towns, there are notable absences of subjects such as calculus and physics while subjects revolving around socialist political theory and the arts get more precedence in schooling.

FAUD has viewed the treatment of gays and lesbians in this manner as incredibly barbaric and backward, which is why it came as little surprise to any when they decriminalized homosexuality and enacted legal protections towards them. Under the new laws, homosexuals will be granted equal opportunities in all levels of government, employment, and military service with any institutional discrimination towards or hate crimes towards them being met with legal punishment. The most controversial aspect of these new laws is the protections of the very small transsexual community in Germany, which even some members of FAUD think is going a bit too far as it might bolden the already inflamed reactionary resistance to these new laws.

This declaration firmly places the militias as the main military force of Germany and to be the institution most trusted with maintaining and upholding the revolution behind the unions and councils themselves.

To keep these minority groups down any longer would be a disgrace to German history and its people, which is why during a recent session of FAUD unions it was agreed on that more action should be taken to ensure that these groups are treated equally. Aside from the anti-discrimination laws against them, unions and communes have instituted employment quotas for minority groups every year to ensure that they get better chances of employment. Failure to hit the quotas might result in potential fines and punishments towards the unions and communes that do so. This is perhaps the most controversial action taken by FAUD so far, as it was the first FAUD vote to receive a decent amount of union opposition to.

Named the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo for short, this new centralized police agency will answer only directly to the will of the People’s Parliament and has carte blanche to run operations as they see fit for the sake of Germany and the Revolution. The parliament voted for militia leader and longtime loyalist Ernst Wollweber to be the Gestapo’s first head. Since the creation of the Gestapo, there are already various confirmed disappearance of some German citizens and some of the more vocal members of the opposition have gone strangely silent if they weren’t apart of the disappeared already.

The methods tend to differ based on who carries it out; the Gestapo prefers a method called “Sardine Packing where reactionaries lay down in a deep ditch only to be shot while the next row lays on top of their corpses to repeat the process, while some of the red militias prefer using mounted machine guns to mow down lined up crowds before pilling their corpses to be doused with gasoline and set on fire. There are even rumors going around that one militia, Rotkämpferbund Radek, has preformed various cruel acts on those meant to be executed, with some claims saying that some are hunted like animals or dragged by vehicles, not even mentioning the stories of rape and use of reactionaries as targets for shooting practice.

Despite whatever challenges they may have put up, Pieck’s faction has been weakened to a point where they can be removed from the picture as a whole. Which is why the People’s Parliament issued arrest warrants for Pieck and the upper echelons of his clique so that they could be brought to public trial. International observers remarked that the trials were conducted with an usual degree of fairness, as the defendants were given proper lawyers to defend them along with time to make their case. However, it did not change the fact that the presiding jury had been entirely comprised of SMEPD bureaucrats or low ranking militia members, or the fact that some of the evidence and witness testimonies were either partially or fully fabricated to match some of the charges against them. In the end, Pieck along with his inner circle and lieutenants were found guilty of a variety of charges, with all of them having their party membership, along with any awards and titles, revoked and being prohibited of holding a position of power or political office again. The courts even went as far as the place Pieck and some others on indefinite house arrest.

It is designed with twelve ring roads the size of an autobahn between each several blocks of massive apartment buildings, shops, bureaus, government buildings and monuments all in a streamlined minimalist neo classic design developed by Albert Speer.\nThree of the rings have been designated to almost completely become lavishly designed parks with sculptures and monuments to the fallen Germans of the past centuries and to the greatest minds Germany has brought forward all overshadowed by a 90 meters high statue of Arminius the first unifier of the Germanic tribes.\nAt the center of the city a massive party gathering and future parliament building is planned simply called the ‘Grosse Halle’ it will be able to host up to 180.000 people at once, leading to it lays the main road which will have a giant triumph arc on the seventh ring followed by a series of small monuments on each side of the main road in both directions in and out of the city.\nOne of the most intriguing parts is the extensive tram and subway system which will be directly connected to a central station of the Reichsautobahn network, it’s underground subway section has been build with the potential threat of the ‘atomic bomb’ in mind as a massive shelter connected to several underground sections of the city that could sustain a fully functional and working society of around 100.000 people for roughly a month. The tram also would have a direct connection to the planned ‘Germania Lufthafen’ which will on completion be the largest airport of the world, having sixteen runways and ten terminals planned so far.\nAnother tramline would lead to the planned Germania Stadium a sports stadium that could host up to 400.000 visitors on maximum capacity which would only make up 5% of the population planned to live in the city with it’s apartments having housing capacities for 8 million people.\nIf the city is to be located near the water there will also be a massive harbour complex offering more docking space than Wilhelmshaven and Hamburg together for both civilian and military vessels.\n\nHow long will this take… again and where will it be build?"

uberreichmisc.1000.d:0 "As the CDU under Konrad Adenauer finalizes it's reforms of the great German nation, bringing us once more under God's light after such a long period of the secular governance of the Socialist Party, many have begun to question our dedication to Republicanism. While the CDU and like-minded liberal parties were long barred from holding power due to our long standing existence within the Reich, when the Socialist Party won the congress, then went on to liberalize the revolutionary state, the CDU and the other parties were quick to jump ship, in hopes of returning Germany to a less revolutionary mode of governance. Running up to the election, and even after our victory to even the present day as we stand atop a reformed Germany, many accused us of wanting to restore the Kaiser, and undo every good thing the Revolution has brought for the nation. While it would be a lie to say that the CDU lacked a monarchist wing, being the largest conservative party in Germany it was inevitable, they make up a very small part of the party as a whole. However, with our reforms by and large complete, this faction has finally made their long-expected move and has formally proposed before Parliament that a referendum on the restoration of the Monarchy beheld. Proclaiming that restoring the Kaiser would be a great boon for national stability. The Monarchists have also clarified that unlike under the Reich, the Kaiser would have no constitutional authority, and would only be but a figurehead. They furthered their case by saying that the people of Germany never got the formal chance to decide themselves if the Kaiser should remain. While indeed the Revolution would have survived if not for the people's support, that is no true mark on the fate of the Monarchy. Regardless, due to the stranglehold we have over the legislature, should we support the measure, it would be all but guaranteed to pass."

uberreichmisc.1001.t:0 "Return of the Kaiserreich"
uberreichmisc.1001.d:0 "Much to the surprise of even the most ardent monarchist within government,  the Referendum to restore the Kaiser has been approved by the German people by a whopping 64% of the population voting in favor of restoring a figurehead Kaiser. Due to the fact that the Kaiser shall only be a symbolic position and for the fact that they still contest our legitimacy despite our shared outlook, the exiled government of the Kaiserreich, still existing in the far-flung reaches of the old colonial empire, has decried the move. Claiming the restored German Empire to be nothing but a mockery of the Reich it it's true glory,  and has proclaimed they will carry on the fight to restore Wilhelm II and his rightful heirs to the throne. With this being the case, the question of just who to give the restored crown to has arisen./n/nWith Kaiser Wilhelm refusing to acknowledge our legitimacy even now, the triumphant monarchists have presented before the reborn Reichstag five possible candidates to be crowned as Kaiser. The first of these candidates is Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, fourth son of Wilhelm II and a true German through and through.  August Wilhelm or 'Awui', has long been the black sheep of the royal family, due to primarily his 'effeminate tendencies,' but also due to his fierce nationalism for the German people. Due to his estrangement with his father and viewing his retreating as cowardice, Awui refused to leave Germany, electing to stay and carry on the fight against the new revolutionary government. Eventually however, he would be forced to flee to nearby Austria, in fears of being captured and tried for his crimes. By crowning Awui, not only would we be crowning a very legitimate claimant, but one who has actually fought for the German people's freedom from socialist tyranny.\n\nThe second candidate put before the Reichstag is Princess Victoria Louise, youngest child of Wilhelm II and his only daughter. While by far the most unorthodox choice, she would be the first Kaiserin after all, and a woman inheriting the throne is highly dubious thing in it of itself, Victoria is not without her perks. The Princess was and still remains one of the most popular of the royal family, at the same time, she lacks nearly all political ambition. With her popularity and lack of wanting to exert pollical influence, the fact she is a woman can nearly be overlooked. Unlike her brother Awui, Victoria did flee with the rest of the royal family, however she and her husband fled to Switzerland instead of going overseas to carry on the fight. Just like many nobility, this youngest of the Hohenzollerns returned to Germany as our government undid many of the horrors of the revolutionary government.\n\nThe third candidate is none other then Rupprecht I of Bavaria. A devout Catholic and coming from a long and proud linage, Rupprecht is seen as the perfect non-Hohenzollern candidate to throne. Fleeing to Austria with his family at the fall of the Reich, the exiled King returned much like Princess Victoria. Due to the very nature of the election, should Rupprecht be chosen as Kaiser, the title of German Emperor would be shifted from the King of Prussia to the King of Bavaria, a prospect that many find disturbing.\n\nThe last two candidates that have been presented to the Reichstag are both of the House of Hohenzollern, but to varying degrees. The first of these candidates is Louis Ferdinand, son of Crown Prince Wilhelm, and third in line to the Imperial Throne. By far the most legitimate claimant before us, Louis Ferdinand is only an option due to the fact that he was captured during the evacuation of the Kaiserreich. While young, Louis being crowned could be enough to get us at least within talking distance of the Exiles. Lastl before the Reichstag stands Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia. An obscure great-grandson of Frederick William III, Friedrich was once considered for the throne of Finland, however due to the Catholicism of his wife, he was rejected in favor of Frederick Charles of Hesse. Due to both the fact that he is a Hohenzollern and that the CDU itself has a strong Catholic bent, he stands a very real chance to gain the throne of Germany.\n\nRegardless, the Reichstag must soon come to a decision, so that the throne of Germany need no longer be vacant."
