# Deutsches-Uberreich [v1.1]

The submod that was too hot for steam is finally on Github.

## How to Install:
The folder that stores mods for the game is:

Windows: ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\
Linux: ~/.paradoxinteractive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/ or ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/
Mac: ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/
Manually downloaded mods should include a .mod text file along with a folder. If so, the files can simply be dropped into the mod file. If one is downloading a newer version of a mod they already have installed, one should remove the older files first.
